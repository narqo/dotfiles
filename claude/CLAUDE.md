# Foundational Rules

## Accessing external data

- When user refers to a GitHub PR, an issue, or results of GitHub CI run, *always* use `gh` CLI to read the content.

## Coding style

- *Never* add obvious code comments. When you think a comment is needed, prefer comments that answer to *why* the code here, and NOT to *what* the code is doing.

## Writing style

- Keep headlines concise; eliminate unnecessary words.
- Use title case for first-level headlines; use sentence case for second and lower levels.
